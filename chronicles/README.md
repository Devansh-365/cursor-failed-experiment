# Cherry Project Chronicles

This directory contains development checklists for the Cherry credit card reward optimization waitlist project. Each checklist is broken down into bite-sized tasks that build on each other, providing a clear roadmap for development.

## Checklists Overview

1. **[Infrastructure & Setup](./01-infrastructure-setup.md)**
   - Project initialization
   - Database setup
   - Project structure

2. **[Frontend Development](./02-frontend-development.md)**
   - Design system implementation
   - Core UI components
   - Landing page development
   - Waitlist form creation
   - Animations & interactions
   - Accessibility & performance optimizations

3. **[Backend Development](./03-backend-development.md)**
   - Database schema implementation
   - API endpoints creation
   - Validation logic
   - Business logic implementation
   - Security measures
   - Testing & monitoring setup

## How to Use These Checklists

- Start with the Infrastructure & Setup checklist to establish the project foundation
- Tasks can be tackled in sequence within each section
- Mark tasks as complete using `- [x]` syntax in the markdown files
- Feel free to add, modify, or reprioritize tasks as needed
- Use these checklists to track progress and ensure no critical tasks are overlooked

## Development Workflow

1. Complete the initial infrastructure setup
2. Work in parallel on frontend and backend tasks when possible
3. Integrate and test components as they are completed
4. Address usability, accessibility, and performance as you build
